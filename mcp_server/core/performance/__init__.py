"""
Performance optimization package for WinDbg MCP Extension.

This package provides performance optimization features specifically designed for
kernel debugging over network connections, including data compression, result
caching, streaming for large outputs, and network optimization.

The package is organized into focused modules:
- caching.py: Result caching with TTL (Time-To-Live)
- compression.py: Data compression for large outputs
- streaming.py: Streaming handler for huge results
- command_optimizer.py: Command batching and optimization
- coordinator.py: Main performance optimizer coordinator
